# Ramen-CNN
Japan’s hearty dish– ramen is typically classified by its broth type, with the main varieties of shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), miso, and tonkotsu (porkbone). Another popular way of eating ramen is tsukemen, categorized by the separation of the broth in one bowl and the dipping noodles in another. 

The dataset used will be a ramen dataset from the Department of Informatics at the University of Electro-Communication (Link: https://mm.cs.uec.ac.jp/RamenAsYouLike/ ) . Their dataset contains 555 pairs of original ramen images, categorized into five classes– tonkotsu, shio, shoyu, miso, and spicy, in a separate text file. I added an additional 33 images of tsukemen, upping the amount of classes by one, from five classes to six. Ultimately, there are 588 ramen images belonging to six classes.
